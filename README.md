# PPG-BLE-Patch

# Low-power Wireless PPGâ€“ECG BLE Patch

This project implements a **wearable patch** for physiological signal acquisition, focusing on **Photoplethysmography (PPG)** and **Electrocardiography (ECG)** with **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** connectivity.  
Built around the **ADPD1080 Analog Front-End** and **STM32WB55 MCU**, it supports low-power operation from coin cells.
